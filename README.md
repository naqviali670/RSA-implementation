# RSA-implementation
It is the simple RSA implementation using following algorithms:
1. Fast Modular Exponentitiation
2. Miller-Rabin Primarily test
3. Chinese Remainder Theorem
4. Extended Euclidean Algorithm

Note: It is a functional implementation for higher bits numbers as well i.e. above 1024 bits.
